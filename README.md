# school-management-system
This project is a School Management System developed using Python and MySQL. It serves as a tool for managing various activities, including storing student and staff data, searching for specific student or staff information, removing student or staff records from the database, and printing details of all students and staff. The program is menu-driven and continues to run until the user chooses to exit. It also features password protection to ensure that only authorized personnel can make changes to the database.
